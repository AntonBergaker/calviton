# CrossDump

A task managing navigation app built with Qt.
The project has been developed mainly to run on [CrossControl's](https://crosscontrol.com/) display computers.

Techniques used in the project have been documented in [**DOCS.md**](DOCS.md) (text in Swedish).

## Offline maps

An offline map of Uppsala has been generated and is included in the repo under `offline-maps/`.
Below are instructions for installing the offline map on CrossControl's displays and on Linux.

View [DOCS.md](DOCS.md) for further documentation on creating and using offline maps.

### Install offline maps on CrossControl displays

Copy the offline map to the display's cache directory via SSH:

~~~
scp offline-maps/uppsala.db ccs@192.168.0.163:~
ssh ccs@192.168.0.163
...
sudo su
mv uppsala.db /home/root/.cache/QtLocation/5.8/tiles/mapboxgl/mapboxgl.db
~~~

### Install offline maps on Linux

Copy the offline map to the local cache directory:

~~~
cp offline-maps/uppsala.db ~/.cache/QtLocation/5.8/tiles/mapboxgl/mapboxgl.db
~~~

## Connect to a CrossControl display via Qt Creator

Go to Tools -> Options -> Devices -> Devices

Set "Host name" equal to the IP address of the display.

Test the connection with the "Test" button and finally click OK.

## Running on CrossControl displays

Select compile target matching the display, for example CCpilot VS.

Add `-platform wayland` as "command line arguments".
Optionally use `-platform eglfs` for drawing directly to the framebuffer.
For the `eglfs` setting you also need to SSH into the display and run `/etc/init.d/weston stop`.

Under Run Environment:

- Set `QT_QPA_EVDEV_TOUCHSCREEN_PARAMETERS` to `/dev/input/touchscreen0`
- Set `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` to `/run/user/root`

## Profiling the app

Enable an FPS counter by adding the following code to the bottom of `main.qml`, which will print information to the console:

```
import com.crossdump.fpscounter 1.0

FPSCounter {
    id: fpsCounter
    width: 100
    height: 100
}
Text {
    text: fpsCounter.fps
}
```
